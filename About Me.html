    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    </center>
    <br>
    <p>
        Hi! I am Mark Rolyn Briz 19 years old a College student taking Bachelor of Sciences in Information Technology
    <br>at College of Science Technology and Communication Inc.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hi! As a Teenager, this is me a simple youth like others studying and already in college, constantly finishing school for a better future. I am also one of the young people who are
    <br>facing a mental issue, we know that its hard but we have to fight not for others but for ourselves. As a young person, it is also inevitable to have personal problems
    <br>that sometimes cause me to have a mental issue to overthink. But with every challenge I face, I continue to fight these challenges to have a better life.
    </p>

    <p>
        Every person has a role to be played. It could be as a parent, sibling, child, teacher, student and etc. I, as a student I always dream of being successful in life someday,
    <br>I dreamed of being comfortable in life forever. All of us have a dream that we want to come true. There are a lot of problems and challenges that we have to face before we
    <br>achieve our dreams or to be in the position that we want to be. As a student I‚Äôm studying not because I want to pass but because I want to learn something which I can use in
    <br>the near future. It was just one of the tests I had to go through in order for me to achieve the success I had hoped for. If I don‚Äôt listen in class, I won‚Äôt learn. I won‚Äôt be
    <br>able to comprehend if I am doing something else every time our teacher is discussing a certain topic.
    </p>

    <p>
        What might a student do at school? Are they just studying? Where does a student go after he or she finished school hours? Go home immediately? These are just a few of the questions
    <br>that can provide clarity to students like me. What exactly do we do at school? Entering the classroom, some are eager to listen to the teacher, some are chattering, some are sleepy,
    <br>others do not care what the teacher says. Which one are you? Where are we going after class? Some will go straight home, and others will wander off. How can you succeed in life if
    <br>you are a student who cannot do your job well? Wouldn‚Äôt it be easier to be successful in life if you have self-discipline? Do the right thing, I‚Äôm not saying you should just focus
    <br>on studying while you are a student, but for me study comes first before going out, you can have fun when you are done studying the lessons. Ignoring your works and prioritizing
    <br>having fun can cause you to fail to achieve what you dream of in life. It is not easy to be a student because there are lots of works to do.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are many difficult things that have to be overcome like doing homework. If you are not listening, you definitely won‚Äôt know how to answer the question given by your teacher.
    <br>Other difficult things that a student does are, Research Papers, Journals, Term Papers, etc. These are the trials that we have to go through in order for us to achieve our dreams
    <br>in life. Other hardships that we need to face as a student is being a child, friend, and a citizen. Being a child and a student cannot go together, why? For example, if you are working
    <br>on a project and you didn‚Äôt finish it right away, you have to do it on weekends, but we all knew that those days are supposed to be spent with our family. What should you prioritize?
    <br>Nor can being a friend coincide with being a student. Why? For example, your friends agreed that you would go out to have some fun, but you have an exam tomorrow and you have to study,
    <br>what will you prioritize? We all have our own habits, not everyone has the same decisions and others will take precedence over being a student, a child, and a friend. For me and for my
    <br>fellow students, we would do the task that needs to be done so that we can be professionals someday.
    </p>

    <p>
        How do you spend your time every day?  What things did you do that took your time? Thus it makes you productive? Do you act with faith?
    <br>Giving or spending a short time for worshipping is still an act of faith. A simple prayer everyday can start a strong relationship with
    <br>god it‚Äôs not just a prayer, it‚Äôs a Faith and you‚Äôre a Believer. ‚ÄúPrayers can move mountain‚Äù, pray with faith nothing is impossible for god.
    <br>Ask, believe and he‚Äôll give.  Praying is also a way of having a conversation with the Lord. Sometimes our intention to pray is to ask for help,
    <br>ask for things we want. Sometimes is to ask for forgiveness for our sins and beg for his embrace. Praying can also be worshipping and praising
    <br>gives it to him with true faith and love. Your relationship with him can start from Praying and to have a strong connection with him.
    <br>Through prayer and faith everything is possible.
    <br>As my life goes on I have been part of a Parish Youth Ministry, am youth servant in our church for nine years until now. During my nine years of service I have learned and realized a lot
    <br>in myself as a youth, and through my service to the Lord, he formed my faith in him. As time goes by being part of some organization in church I have been elected as Vice President in a
    <br>Social Communication organization by the guidance and will of the Lord. As a part of Parish youth it makes me feel happy and it influence me in a good way, and because of this I get to
    <br>know more about our almighty god. I should share this to you that for as long as we live let the lord move in our lives, let him lead and light your way.
